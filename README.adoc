= Endnotes For _The DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, & Security in Technology Organizations_

Authors: Gene Kim, Patrick Debois, John Willis, Jez Humble

Amazon link: https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002/

Anyone interested in the topics covered in The DevOps Handbook will likely find the citations interesting and potentially useful.

I've extracted all the endnotes from the book, which are in a very usable form: they show the page number (as per the paperback edition), as well as three words that the citation is anchored to, and then a citation that has been fact-checked.

Enjoy!  Pull requests welcome!

Cheers,
Gene
